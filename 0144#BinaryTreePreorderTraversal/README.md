Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

examples

    Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
    Output: [1,2,3]

    Input: root = []
    Output: []

    Input: root = [1]
    Output: [1]

constraints

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100]
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100
